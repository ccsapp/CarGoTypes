# Go Types of Car
This repository provides shared data types for the [Car](https://github.com/ccsapp/Car) domain microservice API.

In particular, they were derived from the
[OpenAPI Specification of Car](https://github.com/ccsapp/CarDesign/blob/main/openapi.yaml).

## Usage
To use the types in your project, add the following to your `go.mod` file:
```
require github.com/ccsapp/cargotypes v1.0.0
```
